primary key field - unique ids

foreign key in one table connects to primary key in other table

relational databases - storing tabular structured data

NoSQL databases - flexible structure for storing data
    document db
    key value db
    graph db

DB history
    1970s-1990s - flat files, hierarchical, network
    1980s-now - relational
    1990s-now - object oriented, object relational, web enabled

Structured Query Language (SQL)

relational DBs
    tables to store data
    columns for attributes
    each record - row - usually has attr per data point
    primary key - unique ID per record (row)
    foreign key - used for relations between data (link pkeys)

object-oriented DBs
    entities or classes (instead of tables) with attrs, behaviors

NoSQL DBs
    speed and flexibility in storing data over relational DBs
    process unstructured big data from facebook, reddit, google, etc.
    + higher scale
    + distributed
    + lower costs
    + flexible schema
    + no complex relationships
    + can process unstructured, semi-structured data

    types of NoSQL DBs:
    json - fields, vals (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects)
    key value
    wide col - table, rows, dynamic cols
    graph - node (info about ppl, places, things), edge (relationships btwn nodes)

Structured Query Language (SQL)

relational DBs
    MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server

Database Management System (DBMS) - translates SQL instructions into format DB understands

SQL subsets
    Data definition language
    Data manipulation language
    Data query language
    Data control language

DDL Commands
    Create (db)
    Alter (add new col to table)
    Drop (remove obj from existing db)
    Insert (add more data to table)
    Update (edit existing data in table in db)
    Delete (one or more rows of table in db)

DQL Select
    retrieve data from db with certain filters

DCL revoke
    grant and revoke users' access to data

SQL can work on any OS

see sql_commands.sql

cols hold datatype (string, int, char, date and time, binary, numeric)
    they describe the data in it
    FirstName, LastName, ProductID, Price

domain - set of options that an attr can be
    id can only have ints for example
    ID / Primary Key must be unique, could be combo of cols
        if a single col isn't all unique


Numeric data types such as INT, TINYINT, BIGINT, FLOAT, REAL.
Date and time data types such as DATE, TIME, DATETIME.
Character and string data types such as CHAR, VARCHAR.
Binary data types such as BINARY, VARBINARY.
Miscellaneous data types such as:
    Character Large Object (CLOB) for storing a
        large block of text in some form of text encoding.
    Binary Large Object (BLOB) for storing a
        collection of binary data such as images.

relational db terminology
    table is known as a relation
    table row / record known as a tuple
    schema - structure
        - name of table or relation
        - table attrs
        - their names
        - data type

primary key
    field or col in table to uniquely identify a tuple (row) in a relation (table)
    if no column has all unique vals, can make a composite pkey
        from multiple cols if they result in unique identifiers

foreign key
    link tables together through a key column (pkey) of one table
        which is present in the related table as a foreign key

Integrity Constraints - for all tables in db
Key Constraints
    1+ cols or fields that can be used to fetch data from tables (pkey)
    should be a col or cols in a table that can fetch data for any row
    key attr or pkey != NULL and not be duplicate for diff rows
Domain Constraints
    rules defined for values in each column
    phone number has to be 10 digits
    home address cannot be in name field etc
Referential Integrity Constraints
    when tables are related via fkey col, referenced col must exist in other table
    table1 uses student id as pkey, table2 uses student id as fkey <-> and
    both tables have that identical col present


The structure of a database consists of a set of key components. These include:
    Tables or entities, where the data is stored.
    Attributes which are details about the table or entity. In other words, attributes describe the table.
    Fields, which are columns used to capture attributes.
    A record, which is one row of details about a table or entity.
    And the primary key, which is a unique value for an entity.

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
    visual repr of how db will be impl into tables during phys db design
    using a DBMS like MySQL or Oracle

Logical DB Structure
    entity instance relationships
    1 <-> 1
    1 <-> many
    many <-> many
cardinality of relationships

Candidate key attribute
    any attr that contains a unique val in each row of the table

Composite key attribute
    key made of 2+ attrs to form a uniq val in each new row

Alternate key
    candidate key not selected as pkey

Foreign key
    attr that refs a uniq key in another table
